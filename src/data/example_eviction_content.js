  narrative: `Before the dramatic wall collapse of 173, 175 and 177 Maverick St. on
Saturday which displaced 30 East Boston residents, if you walked into
Hoober Alvarez’ apartment and looked up, you would be able to see the
upstairs neighbor’s floor through a 5 foot long hole in the ceiling. In
this same building, families went without heat, water or electricity during
the coldest months of last winter without response from their landlord.

However, when the landlord decided to give rent increases to all of the
tenants in these buildings (in one case, as high as a $1,000 increase),
residents had had enough. They used their legal rights to fight for better
building conditions and to try to negotiate a long-term lease with
reasonable rent increases.
