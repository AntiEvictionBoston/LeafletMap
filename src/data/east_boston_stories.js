    story: `Thirty-one tenants, including 8 children, were displaced when the back wall of their adjacent buildings partially collapsed (shortly prior to the collapse, they had received a rent increase). After months of living in hotels, several families took refuge in the basement of Our Saviour's Lutheran Church nearby. One family continues to live in the church 7 months after the collapse. The owner would not rehabilitate the apartments for the tenants who lived there.`
