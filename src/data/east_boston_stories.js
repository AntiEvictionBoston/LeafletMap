    story: `When Alex Hodara bought the building Ana and Luis live in, he served no-fault eviction notices to the tenants the next month. "We didn't get an exact explanation for why they had to evict us," says Luis, whose child with special needs attends a nearby school. Seven tenants in this building signed a letter to Hodara demanding a "just cause" for eviction.`,

    story: `Thirty-one tenants, including 8 children, were displaced when the back wall of their adjacent buildings partially collapsed (shortly prior to the collapse, they had received a rent increase). After months of living in hotels, several families took refuge in the basement of Our Saviour's Lutheran Church nearby. One family continues to live in the church 7 months after the collapse. The owner would not rehabilitate the apartments for the tenants who lived there.`,

First, Natalia and the other tenants here received rent increases - Natalia's increase was $600 a month. After that, "We received a 14-day eviction notice," says Natalia. The owner apparently wanted to "clear out" the building.`,

    story: `When Alex Hodara bought this building, he gave no-fault eviction notices to all the tenants. At first, Idalia didn't fully understand the eviction notice, written only in English. So, she brought it to City Hall, and they told her it meant that she had 30 days to leave her house.`,

    story: `All of the tenants in this building received a no-fault eviction notice. Marta, one of the renters, says, "When I tried to get in touch with the new owners, they told me it was because the tenants of this building couldn't manage to pay between $1800 and $2100 a month - I pay $1300 a month - and it was for that reason that we were being evicted." Marta adds, "We're always talking with the people in our community about what's going on in East Boston, that they should push for their rights, that they should know that we have rights too."`,

    story: `Alma and Obdulio have two young children. They moved to Boston from Mexico about 10 years ago. They've lived in their current apartment less than half of that time. Their landlord, who owns several properties in East Boston, gave them a rent increase of $250 per month and later a 30-day eviction notice. "This case is definitely part of a bigger trend in East Boston of the displacement of families, especially lower-income families, immigrant families," says Hannah, Alma and Obdulio's attorney.`,

There are about 15 units here, and almost everyone else had already left. "I've lived in this building here for 16 years," says Felicha. "I've been a good tenant. I pay my rent. I just don't think it's fair."`,
