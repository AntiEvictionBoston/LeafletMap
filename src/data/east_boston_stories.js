Large corporate landlords like Hodara Real Estate Group, Newman Properties, RJ Leyden and Aaron Daigneault are buying and redeveloping scores of homes throughout East Boston, raising rents and forcing no-fault evictions in process, while 2016 began with over 10 larger high-end housing developments underway.`,

    The landlord raised Ms. Huang's rent in 2015 by $300 a month, and in 2016 is seeking to raise the rent again by another $250. Ms. Huang asked the landlord to lower the rate of rent increases, because her family is now paying more than 50% of their income in rent.
    
    Ms. Zhong's rent has risen by several hundred dollars to a total of $2600 per month. Because Ms. Zhong's family can't afford $2600 per month, and they're unable to find an affordable alternative in Chinatown, they're likely to be displaced from Chinatown in the spring of 2016."`,

They continue to be the only ones left, and it's uncertain where the family will end up.`,
